                <p>Kerey Khan, son of Pulad Sultan and a descendant of Uruz Khan, was one of the founders of the Kazakh Khanate. In the 1450s, he and his brother Zhanibek, dissatisfied with the rule of Abulkhair Khan in the White Horde, separated from him and moved to Moghulistan, where they received support from the Khan of Moghulistan, Esenbuga, who provided them with land.</p>
                <p>After the death of Abulkhair Khan in 1468, Kerey Khan and Zhanibek Khan continued their struggle for power in Eastern Dzhungaria, aiming to establish an independent state. Kerey Khan passed away in 1473 or 1474. His legacy remains significant in the history of Kazakhstan, and in 2010 a monument was erected in Astana to commemorate Kerey and Zhanibek, the founders of the Kazakh Khanate.</p>
